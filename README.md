# Images_processing_code

This repo is used to store my R codes to automate the fieldwork image processing.
1. Video_to_pictures.R contains R code to convert the videos into pictures.
2. Image_selection.R contains R code to select images with yellow circle in the area of the cables.
3. Central_pixel.R contains R code in progress to find the central pixel of the yellow circle in the image selected in the script before.
4. Triangulation.R contains R code to calculate altitude and distance of a bird using two paired images.
5. Cam_coordinates.csv contains a spreadsheet with x and y min and max pixels location for croping each camera image in the area near the cable where I want to look for yellow circles.
6. Top_tower.csv contains a spreadsheet in progress with x and y location indicating the pixel that represents the top of the tower in each camera.
7. Image_selection_results_test.csv contains a spreadsheet with the output from a test of the script Image_selection.R, using two images from each camera.
